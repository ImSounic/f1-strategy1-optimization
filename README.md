# F1 Strategy Optimization

![F1 Strategy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image.png)

## 🚀 About the Project
F1 Strategy Optimization is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict and compare race strategies for Formula 1. It analyzes historical data, tire performance, and weather conditions to recommend the best race strategies for teams and drivers.

## 📌 Features
- **Predicts Best Race Strategy** based on historical data.
- **Alternative Strategy Comparisons** for different tire strategies.
- **Driver-Specific Strategy** based on grid position.
- **Graphical Visualization** of lap times and pit stop timing.
- **Real-time Weather Integration** (Planned).

## 🔧 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImSounic/F1-Strategy-Optimization.git
cd F1-Strategy-Optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the strategy optimizer:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🛣 Roadmap
### Phase 1: Finalizing the Core Algorithm (✅ Done)
- ✅ Implement best strategy prediction based on historical data.
- ✅ Compare alternative strategies.
- ✅ Predict driver-specific strategies based on grid position.

### Phase 2: Version Control & Documentation
- 🔹 Upload the existing Python project to GitHub.
- 🔹 Finalize README and add installation/setup instructions.
- 🔹 Set up GitHub Issues for tracking improvements.

### Phase 3: Web Application Development
- 🔹 Choose a web framework (FastAPI for backend + React or Next.js for frontend).
- 🔹 Design an interactive UI for strategy visualization.
- 🔹 Implement user input fields for selecting a Grand Prix, driver, and grid position.

### Phase 4: Backend Implementation
- 🔹 Create API endpoints to return strategy results.
- 🔹 Optimize data handling and caching to improve performance.
- 🔹 Implement error handling for API failures.

### Phase 5: Frontend Development
- 🔹 Build a visually appealing dashboard.
- 🔹 Use **charts & graphs** to display strategies dynamically.
- 🔹 Allow users to compare multiple strategies side by side.

### Phase 6: Deployment & CI/CD
- 🔹 Deploy backend to **Render, Railway, or AWS**.
- 🔹 Deploy frontend using **Vercel or Netlify**.
- 🔹 Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
- 🔹 Introduce live weather API integration.
- 🔹 Implement **real-time race data tracking**.
- 🔹 Add a **strategy recommender AI model**.

### Phase 8: Desktop Application
- 🔹 Convert the web app into a **desktop app** using **Electron or Tauri**.
